This is a simple web application that evaluates skincare ingredient lists and flags potential irritants.
The user pastes the ingredient list of a skincare product. The ingredients are then parsed into individual components and verified against a small set of common irritants. The app determines whether the product is safe, unsafe, or if the user needs to exercise caution when using it.
